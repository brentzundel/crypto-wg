_For this call, you are encouraged to turn your video on. This is a good way to build rapport given we are a large, disparate group experiencing a lot of churn._

### Notes


## Meeting - Thursday 8th July 2021 - (3pm ET)

### Agenda

1. Intro w/ IPR
2. Introductions
3. Work Items

### Attendees

- David Waite
- Jeremie Miller
- Brent Zundel
- Daniel Buchner
- Andreas Freitag
- Andrew Whitehead
- Kristina Yasuda
- Mike Jones
- Srinath Setty
- Juan Caballero
- Brian Richter

### Notes

- Not all participants had signed the charter, but the process was well underway.
- Individuals introduced theselves
- We discussed possible work items:
    1. BBS+ - extending them with SNARKs
    2. Revocation - what are the use case requirements?
    3. ZK-Authorization Policies
    4. JSON Web Proofs (JWPs) - ZKP-capable JWTs 
    5. Blind Signatures/Blind Encryption
- Had a discussion about being a work item owner and what that might entail, e.g.,
    - leading the effort to produce some body of work
    - organizing meetings specific to that work item
    - managing GitHub or other resources dedicated to the work item
    - Serving as an editor for the work item output
    - reporting back to the WG on progress
- talked briefly about how best to use meeting time


## Meeting - Thursday 24th June 2021 - (3pm ET)

Pre-working group meeting

### Agenda

1. Welcome and introductions
2. Discussion about working group scope and focus


### Attendees

- David Waite
- Jeremie Miller
- Tobias Looker
- Daniel Buckner
- Andreas Freitag
- Andrew Whitehead
- Daniel Buckner

### Notes

A general discussion was had on different concepts that are applicable under the working groups charter

#### Possible TOPICS for the group

**SSI cryptographic protocol topics**
- BBS+ (supports the ability for predicate proofs)
- Revocation methods
- Which crypto primitives we should use / we recommend: Curves,etc.

**General cryptographic topics relevant for SSI:**
- JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE)
- Fuzzy encryption
- Use of Pseudonyms (stable ID between holder and verifier -> for a recovery method without correlation)
 
**Education, Description and Definitions:**
- Definitions, glossary and concepts for onboarding and education.
- Focus on good sources and links and explaining what we use in the group an mean
- Group signatures
- Message encryption
- Multi message Signatures
- Zero knowledge Proofs (SNarks, SPARCs,….)
- Cryptographic Accumulators
- Predicate proofs (membership and non membership proofs)
- Pairing crypto
- Definitions of problems in SSI which we can maybe solve with crypto
- eg. Correlation
- PoV to actual topics
- Different kind of attacks on crypto
- Organise code/security reviews of libraries we use
- Review of crypto papers
